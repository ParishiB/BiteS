Meet the brilliant yet eccentric Dr. Emmett Brown, better known as Doc. Hopelessly stuck in 2023, he is fixing his
time machine to go back to the future and save his friend. His favourite online store FluxKart.com sells all the
parts required to build this contraption. As crazy as he might get at times, Doc surely knows how to be careful. To
avoid drawing attention to his grandiose project, Doc is using different email addresses and phone numbers for
each purchase.

FluxKart.com is deadpan serious about their customer experience. There is nothing more important than
rewarding their loyal customers a#nd giving a personalised experience. To do this, FluxKart decides to integrate
Bitespeed into their platform. Bitespeed collects contact details from shoppers for a personalised customer
experience.
However, given Doc's modus operandi, Bitespeed faces a unique challenge: linking different orders made with
different contact information to the same person.

# Approach for various cases

## CASE - I If none of the the phonenumber or email is not present in db, so a new row will be created

## CASE II if either of the phone number or email is present so we create a new row and send thee response iwth all the primarycontactt

## CASE III if we want to change the primary contact to secondary contact

## CASE IV both the email and phoneNumber are present in the same row
